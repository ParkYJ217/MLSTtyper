MLST Typer

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) protocol was designed to overcome the low discriminatory power and poor reproducibility of older molecular typing schemes, and is useful for inter-laboratory, inter-regional, and inter-national comparison of the pathogenic clones. However, MLST includes labor-intensive sequencing processes and meticulous allelic / ST determination processes, often prone to errors. “MLST typer” is a free, automated program based on Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro, which runs through Microsoft Excel
